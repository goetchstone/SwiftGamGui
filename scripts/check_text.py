"""Refuse invisible and bidirectional-control characters in tracked text files.

They make code read differently from how it runs (Trojan Source, CVE-2021-42574), and an editing tool
can write one by decoding an escape a script meant to keep (RULE-FEEDBACK 2026-10-08). Write such
characters as escapes. Only the generated argv fixture is exempt: it is data from GamGUI built to
exercise exactly these characters. The mock and its data are hand-written and run by the tests.
